# CSS-Worksheet_UN_Starter-main_Lab

This project will have you open an html file in your browser and a project folder VS Code. 
Read through the text in the browser, you will be prompted to style different parts of the page in different ways.  Your task is to create CSS classes and apply them to elements on index.html to achieve the desired styles.
There are over 500 different CSS properties, each with several possible values that can be supplied, leading to many thousands of things you can do with CSS. Don’t let this intimidate you! What this means is that CSS is not about memorizing all the possible things you can do, it is instead about good research and thoughtful experimentation.
So for example, if you want to make a box with rounded corners, you would research “css box with rounded corners”, and examine the results that show up. Other good searches could be “css horizontal navbar”, “css center text”,  “css tile background image”, etc. These will show how some people or organizations have used CSS to get a similar result. Once you see an example, try to incorporate it into your own project by adding a new CSS class. Does it look the same as the example? If not, try to make a guess at why not. What might be happening in your project that is not in the example, or vice versa?
